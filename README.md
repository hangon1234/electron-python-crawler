# electron-python-crawler
***
This is my first time to use Electron with Python scripts.
I refer __[this](https://medium.com/heuristics/electron-react-python-part-1-introduction-b228ccf8e889)__ article and successfully done my first Electron based project.
The one thing remind to is that don't try to use ZeroRPC, which seems abandoned long time and even can't compile with newer version of NodeJS. You should not use older version of Electron to use zerorpc.
I recommend you to read article I mentioned above and read Electron docs about its architecture.
